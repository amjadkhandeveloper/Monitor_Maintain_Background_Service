## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed (for running JAR files)
- For `.sh` files on macOS/Linux: Ensure scripts have execute permissions

## Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   
   **On Windows:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   **On macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the monitoring server**:
   
   **On Windows:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Or double-click `start_monitor.bat`
   
   **On macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```
   Or run:
   ```bash
   ./start_monitor.sh
   ```

2. **Access the dashboard**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5001
   ```
   
   **Note**: The default port is 5001 (to avoid conflicts with macOS AirPlay Receiver on port 5000). 
   You can specify a different port when starting:
   ```bash
   python3 app.py 8080
   ```

3. **Monitor your services**:
   - Set the folder path where your executable files are located
   - **Folder Structure Support**: The application supports two folder structures:
     
     **Structure 1: Subfolders (Recommended)**
     ```
     Main Folder: C:\Program Files (x86)\Cellocator\Integration Package\
     ├── CorrelatorMax_ITLFMS_5000\
     │   └── CorrelatorMax_ITLFMS_5000.exe
     ├── CorrelatorMax_ITLFMS_6000\
     │   └── CorrelatorMax_ITLFMS_6000.exe
     └── CorrelatorMax_ITLFMS_6001\
         └── CorrelatorMax_ITLFMS_6001.jar
     ```
     - Each subfolder contains an executable file
     - **Folder name must match executable filename** (without extension, case-insensitive)
     - Example: Folder `CorrelatorMax_ITLFMS_5000` contains `CorrelatorMax_ITLFMS_5000.exe`
     - Services execute from within their subfolder (working directory set automatically)
     
     **Structure 2: Direct Files (Backward Compatible)**
     ```
     Main Folder: C:\MyServices\
     ├── Service1.jar
     ├── Service2.exe
     └── Service3.bat
     ```
     - Executable files directly in the main folder
     - Still supported for backward compatibility
   
   - View all available executable files/subfolders in the left sidebar (30% width):
     - **Windows**: `.jar`, `.exe`, `.bat` files
     - **macOS/Linux**: `.jar`, `.sh` files
     - Subfolders are displayed with their executables nested underneath
   - View running services in the right panel (70% width)
   - Click on any executable file in the sidebar to start it
   - File types are color-coded with badges (JAR, EXE, BAT, SH)
   - View CPU and memory utilization for each service
   - **MSMQ Queue Monitoring (Windows Only)**:
     - Queue names are automatically matched to folder names
     - Example: Queue `correlatormax_6000` matches folder `CorrelatorMax_ITLFMS_6000`
     - Queue message count is displayed for each running service
     - Queue-based auto-restart available (independent of CPU/Memory thresholds)
   - Click "Details" to see comprehensive information about a service
   - Use "Stop" to terminate a service
   - Use "Restart" to restart a service
   - **Enable Auto-Restart**: Toggle auto-restart for any service
   - **Set CPU Threshold**: Configure when auto-restart should trigger (default: 80%)
   - **Set Memory Threshold**: Configure memory limit for auto-restart (default: 1000 MB)
   - **Set Queue Threshold**: Configure MSMQ queue message limit for auto-restart (default: 10,000 messages, Windows only)
   - **Automatic Monitoring**: Services are checked every 30 seconds for high CPU, memory, or queue message count

## Important: Detached Process Execution

**Services started through this monitor run as detached processes** - they will continue running even if you stop the monitoring application. This means:

- ✅ Services survive Flask app shutdown
- ✅ Services run independently of the monitor
- ✅ You can safely restart the monitor without affecting running services
- ✅ Services can only be stopped through the dashboard or system process management

This is achieved by:
- **Windows**: Using `DETACHED_PROCESS` and `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` flags
- **macOS/Linux**: Using `start_new_session=True` to create detached processes

## Auto-Restart Feature

The monitor includes an **automatic restart feature** based on CPU and memory utilization:

- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle auto-restart for individual services via the dashboard
- **CPU Threshold**: Set custom CPU threshold (0-100%) - default is 80%
- **Memory Threshold**: Set custom memory threshold (100 MB - 10 GB) - default is 1000 MB (1 GB)
- **Dual Monitoring**: Auto-restart triggers when **either** CPU **OR** memory exceeds threshold
- **Automatic Monitoring**: Background thread checks CPU and memory usage every 30 seconds
- **Smart Restart**: When threshold is exceeded:
  - Service is stopped gracefully
  - **2-minute delay** (120 seconds) to allow memory cleanup and better performance
  - Service is automatically restarted
- **Status Indicators**: 
  - Green: Auto-restart enabled (shows both thresholds)
  - Yellow: Currently restarting (with 2-min delay)
  - Red: Auto-restart disabled

**Benefits:**
- Prevents services from getting stuck with high CPU usage
- Prevents memory leaks and excessive memory consumption
- Automatically frees memory by restarting services
- 2-minute delay ensures proper cleanup before restart
- Services remain available even during restart process
- Dual threshold monitoring catches both CPU spikes and memory leaks

## Configuration Storage

All settings are **persistently stored** in `monitor_config.json`:

- ✅ **Auto-restart configurations** (CPU and memory thresholds)
- ✅ **Folder path** for executable files
- ✅ **Survives Flask app restarts**
- ✅ **Stored by service name** (not PID) - survives service restarts

**Location**: `monitor_config.json` (in the same directory as `app.py`)

**Example configuration**:
```json
{
  "auto_restart": {
    "my-service.jar": {
      "enabled": true,
      "cpu_threshold": 85.0,
      "memory_threshold_mb": 1500.0,
      "jar_name": "my-service.jar"
    }
  },
  "folder_path": "/path/to/jar/folder"
}
```

See `STORAGE_INFO.md` for more details about configuration storage.

## Dashboard Features

### Smart Auto-Refresh
- Dashboard refreshes every **20 seconds** (configurable)
- **Automatically pauses** when you're editing input fields
- Resumes after you finish editing
- Prevents interruptions while configuring thresholds

### File Type Support
- **JAR files**: Java applications (all platforms)
- **EXE files**: Windows executables (Windows only)
- **BAT files**: Windows batch scripts (Windows only)
- **SH files**: Shell scripts (macOS/Linux only)

### Visual Indicators
- Color-coded file type badges
- CPU usage bars (red if > 80%)
- Memory usage bars (red if > 1GB)
- Auto-restart status indicators

## API Endpoints

The application provides REST API endpoints for programmatic access:

- `GET /api/services` - Get list of all services with status and utilization
- `GET /api/service/<pid>` - Get detailed information about a specific service
- `POST /api/service/<pid>/stop` - Stop a service
- `POST /api/service/<pid>/restart` - Restart a service (with 2-minute delay)
- `POST /api/service/<pid>/start` - Start a service (requires jar_path in request body)
- `POST /api/service/<pid>/auto-restart` - Configure auto-restart (enable/disable, set CPU and memory thresholds)
- `GET /api/service/<pid>/auto-restart` - Get auto-restart configuration for a service
- `POST /api/folder/set` - Set the folder path for executable files
- `GET /api/folder/jars` - List all executable files in the configured folder

## Troubleshooting

### Service not detected
- Ensure the service is running a supported file type (`.jar`, `.exe`, `.bat`, `.sh`)
- For JAR files: Check that the process has a `.jar` file in its command line arguments
- For `.sh` files: Ensure the script has execute permissions (`chmod +x script.sh`)

### Cannot stop/start services
- Ensure you have administrator privileges if required
- Check that the executable file path is accessible
- Verify that Java is in your system PATH (for JAR files)
- For `.sh` files: Ensure they have execute permissions

### Services continue running after stopping the monitor
- This is **expected behavior** - services are started as detached processes
- Services will continue running independently
- To stop services, use the dashboard "Stop" button or system process manager
- This ensures services remain available even if the monitor needs to be restarted

### High CPU/Memory Usage
- Services showing high utilization (CPU > 80% or Memory > 1GB) are highlighted in red
- Use the "Restart" button to restart stuck services
- Enable auto-restart to automatically handle high usage
- Check service details for more information about resource usage

### Auto-restart not working
- Ensure auto-restart is enabled for the service
- Check that thresholds are set correctly
- Verify the service is running (auto-restart only works for running services)
- Check Flask app logs for any errors

### Configuration not persisting
- Check that `monitor_config.json` file exists and is writable
- Verify file permissions in the application directory
- Check Flask app logs for configuration save errors

## Security Notes

- This application runs on `0.0.0.0:5001` by default (port 5001 to avoid macOS AirPlay Receiver conflict), making it accessible from other machines on your network
- **IMPORTANT**: Set the `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` environment variable for production use:
  ```bash
  export FLASK_SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key-here'
  ```
- Consider adding authentication for production deployments
- Be cautious when exposing this service on public networks
- Never commit sensitive information like API keys, tokens, or passwords to the repository
- The `monitor_config.json` file is excluded from Git (contains local settings)
